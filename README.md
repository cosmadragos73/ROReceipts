# ROReceipts
OCR designed to support Romanian receipts.
I am honestly tired of having to untagle a multitude of receipts.
I am honsetly tired of having to ASK for a receipts.

#Motivation

Please do not ask, why not use the "SHOP NATIVE APP", it will automatically do a digital receipt. 

Magazinu profi , kaufland si lidl din colt care scoate bonu fiscal pe foaie termica, foaie care nu mai ajunge intreaga pana acasa.



# Goal
Provide simple API for reading and exporting data from read receipt.
Organize most of the receipts from Romanian shops via templateing.
Read a receipt, provide untangling and exporting of the data via different configuration options.
Provide ease of use integration
Provide simple PWA ( yes PWA, i want this to work offline without to much hassle)

NO "native" apps
NO React 

CSV,EXCEL, DataFrame,

UNSURE (print formating)

Maybe Python Bidings?

IT SHOULD JUST WORK.
